# sublime-lang

Provided in the repository are the source file for an improved version of the Sublime Text C\+\+ package which contains snippets and reserved word completions. When installed correctly this package overrides the default C\+\+ package without removing it. This has only been tested with Sublime Text 3 beta which is available on Linux Mint 15 or for download from [sublimetext.com](http://sublimetext.com).

To install download [this package](https://bitbucket.org/infektor/sublime-lang/downloads/C++.sublime-package), alternatively you can compress the contents of the C++ directory into a zip archive. Note: Only the files within the directory should be included in the archive and that the archive must not contain the .zip file extension.

The archive should be be placed in the following paths dependent on your operating system:

linux   : `~/.config/sublime-text-3/Installed Packages/C++.sublime-package`

windows : `todo`

osx     : `todo`
